Smartphone generations are getting
shorter and shorter
and that means that sometimes the newest
model coming out may not be a clear
upgrade over the previous one but just
offer something different
this is the case with the new realme 8
pro what's changed here compared to the
realme 7 pro
let's find out in our full review
[Music]
the realme 8 pro was a phone that trades
away a few of the nicer features from
last year's model
in exchange for a new high-res camera it
brings a bold and flashy look with a
metallic gradient finish
and a prominent dare to leap logo across
the backside
the back is made from plastic with a
sandblasted texture that is rather
grippy but feels soft to the touch
the matte plastic frame adds a bit of
grip as well
overall the phone is quite thin and
light and great to handle in one hand
one thing missing on the realme 8 pro is
water resistant coating on the internals
which the realme 7 pro did have it's too
bad because
accidents can happen something that
hasn't changed
much is the display it's again a 6.4
inch amoled panel with a 1080p
resolution
and a regular 60hz refresh rate there is
a small upgrade though in the touch
sampling rate
now it's 180 hertz so the screen is more
responsive
something important for gaming the
realme 8 pro's display is pretty nice
as an amoled it offers excellent
contrast and content is plenty sharp
colors can be made quite accurate if you
adjust them in the color settings
and brightness is great for this class
we measured a maximum of 450 nits with
the slider
and it boosts up to nearly 630 nits in
auto mode when in bright sun
moving on to audio and yeah this is
another downgrade from the real me 7 pro
rather than a pair of stereo speakers
this time around there's a single one at
the bottom
it's not very loud scoring just average
on our charts
and audio quality is just average too
with decent mids but lackluster highs
as an alternative you can also plug in
traditional headphones to the 3.5
millimeter jack
and another popular feature you get here
is expandable storage
on top of the 128 gigs built in
waking up and unlocking the realme 8 pro
can be done with an under display
fingerprint scanner
it's incredibly fast and accurate the
interface of the realme 8 pro is real
miui
2.0 on top of android 11. it has a few
notable features and is quite
customizable
if you don't like the shapes of the
icons the font or the system colors
you can change them all within the
settings there's a lot of variety even
within the dark mode
you have a choice between three
different styles the traditional black
as well as dark gray and light gray
like the recent galaxy phones there is a
smart sidebar which can hold
customizable shortcuts for you
and a special feature here is the
ability to minimize an app to a mini
window
or a floating window straight from the
task switcher
at the heart of the realme 8 pro is a
snapdragon 720 g
chipset it's the same that you'd find in
last year's model
as well as the newly popular samsung
galaxy a52
and as you'd expect performance here is
about on par with these devices
it isn't too bad it can handle games
pretty well and the user interface flows
smoothly without any lag
however it's worth keeping in mind that
in this sort of flagship killer price
range
the charts are full of competitors with
more power under the hood
the realme 8 pro has a decent sized 4
500 milliamp hour battery
the same capacity as the real me 7 pro
and as you'd expect from a phone with
such similar specs
the battery life is basically the same
too the 8 pro scored a very
good endurance rating of 116 hours in
our proprietary tests
versus 113 on the 7 pro however
charging has been downgraded just a bit
here you have support for 50 watt
charging
versus 65 last year but you get a 65
watt adapter in the box
what still that's not to say it isn't
incredibly fast here
we were able to charge the realme 8 pro
from a dead battery to 88
in half an hour now on to the cameras
which are the major upgrade you'll get
here over last year's model
the main cam has a large 108 megapixel
nona cell sensor
versus the 64 megapixel quad bayer one
on the real me seven pro
the rest of the setup is the same though
an 8 megapixel ultrawide camera
a 2 megapixel macro cam and a depth
sensor
photos from the main camera come out at
12 megapixels by default
and these are good they are detailed
enough with excellent contrast
lively colors low noise and impressive
dynamic range
we wouldn't call this flagship worthy
though if you zoom in you'll see that
fine details and textures like foliage
have a sort of smeared oil painting look
perhaps due to the noise processing
don't get us wrong for a mid-range phone
these photos are great
but we were just expecting more from
this flagship grade sensor
one trick this large sensor allows you
to do is cropped to produce lossless
three times
zoomed photos these are pretty awesome
they're rich in detail with well-handled
noise
superb contrast punchy colors and grey
dynamic range
these photos are hard to distinguish
from those taken with a real three times
telephoto
you can also achieve a five times
digital zoom which involves a bit of an
upscale but still looks really good
portraits taken with the main camera and
the depth sensor are impressive
the subjects are sharp and detailed with
proficient separation from the defocus
backgrounds
moving on to the 8 megapixel photos from
the ultrawide cam these are average
looking with mediocre resolve detail
ok contrast and dynamic range which
leaves more to be desired
this is about par for the course for
this price range
shooting close-ups with a macro camera
is pretty difficult because its focus is
fixed
but even if you get the distance right
these are still soft and noisy
with dull colors at night the main
camera takes very balanced and true to
life photos
with gentle noise reduction plenty of
detail lifelike colors and good contrast
you may observe some clipped highlights
though with night mode on
each shot takes from 5 to 10 seconds to
process
maybe due to a combination of the high
resolution sensor and mid-range chipset
these are brighter and the noise is
eliminated but they're also
softer and the problematic highlights
are still visible
the better solution is ai mode if you
switch this on at night the phone
produces an hdr photo with the same
detail and noise levels as auto mode
but gives you a brighter look with
restored highlights and these don't take
any extra time to process
lossless zoom doesn't work at night you
just end up with a standard three times
digital zoom which doesn't look good
low light photos taken with the ultra
wide cam are noisy soft and dark
ai mode doesn't help a lot just giving a
brighter exposure
but the night mode does make a
difference here you get a cleaner
brighter image with more detail and
restored highlights
now on to selfies which are taken with
the 16 megapixel front facing cam
lower res than the 32 megapixel sensor
of last year
the colors contrast and dynamic range
are great even if the dtl level is just
average
the quality is decent here videos can be
captured with the main cam and up to 4k
resolution at 30fps
the quality here is stellar with rich
detail low noise
accurate colors and great dynamic range
our only complaint is that there's no
stabilization available in 4k
the ultra wide shoots in 1080p and these
are just alright
there isn't a lot of resolved detail but
the contrast and dynamic range are good
so that's the ryomi 8 pro overall is a
pretty decent package for a mid-ranger
with an easy to handle body
a nice amoled display great battery life
and super fast charging
and excellent photos and videos from the
main cam at least during the day
the problem is well there are actually
two problems here
first is that someone coming from last
year's model will not only get the same
features
but actually miss out on quite a few and
i'm not sure if the trade-off for a
better camera is worth it for everyone
and the second issue is the pricing you
can find flagship killers from
poco for around the same amount of money
and even if you're just after the
high-res camera
you can get that together with other
upgrades in the redmi note 10 pro
so unless you can find the realme 8 pro
at a discount it's tough to recommend
thanks for watching guys stay safe and
see you on the next one
